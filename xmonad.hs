  Layout configuration. In this section we identify which xmonad
  layouts we want to use. I have defined a list of default
  layouts which are applied on every workspace, as well as
  special layouts which get applied to specific workspaces.

  Note that all layouts are wrapped within "avoidStruts". What this does
  is make the layouts avoid the status bar area at the top of the screen.
  Without this, they would overlap the bar. You can toggle this behavior
  by hitting "super-b" (bound to ToggleStruts in the keyboard bindings
  in the next section).
-}

-- Define group of default layouts used on most screens, in the
-- order they will appear.
-- "smartBorders" modifier makes it so the borders on windows only
-- appear if there is more than one visible window.
-- "avoidStruts" modifier makes it so that the layout provides
-- space for the status bar at the top of the screen.
defaultLayouts = smartBorders(avoidStruts(
  -- ResizableTall layout has a large master window on the left,
  -- and remaining windows tile on the right. By default each area
  -- takes up half the screen, but you can resize using "super-h" and
  -- "super-l".
  ResizableTall 1 (3/100) (1/2) []

  -- Mirrored variation of ResizableTall. In this layout, the large
  -- master window is at the top, and remaining windows tile at the
  -- bottom of the screen. Can be resized as described above.
  ||| Mirror (ResizableTall 1 (3/100) (1/2) [])

  -- Full layout makes every window full screen. When you toggle the
  -- active window, it will bring the active window to the front.
  ||| noBorders Full

  -- Grid layout tries to equally distribute windows in the available
  -- space, increasing the number of columns and rows as necessary.
  -- Master window is at top left.
  ||| Grid

  -- ThreeColMid layout puts the large master window in the center
  -- of the screen. As configured below, by default it takes of 3/4 of
  -- the available space. Remaining windows tile to both the left and
  -- right of the master window. You can resize using "super-h" and
  -- "super-l".
  ||| ThreeColMid 1 (3/100) (3/4)

  -- Circle layout places the master window in the center of the screen.
  -- Remaining windows appear in a circle around it
  ||| Circle))


-- Here we define some layouts which will be assigned to specific
-- workspaces based on the functionality of that workspace.

-- The GIMP layout uses the ThreeColMid layout. The traditional GIMP
-- floating panels approach is a bit of a challenge to handle with xmonad;
-- I find the best solution is to make the image you are working on the
-- master area, and then use this ThreeColMid layout to make the panels
-- tile to the left and right of the image. If you use GIMP 2.8, you
-- can use single-window mode and avoid this issue.

{-
  Custom keybindings. In this section we define a list of relatively
  straightforward keybindings. This would be the clearest place to
  add your own keybindings, or change the keys we have defined
  for certain functions.

  It can be difficult to find a good list of keycodes for use
  in xmonad. I have found this page useful -- just look
  for entries beginning with "xK":

  http://xmonad.org/xmonad-docs/xmonad/doc-index-X.html

  Note that in the example below, the last three entries refer
  to nonstandard keys which do not have names assigned by
  xmonad. That's because they are the volume and mute keys
  on my laptop, a Lenovo W520.

  If you have special keys on your keyboard which you
  want to bind to specific actions, you can use the "xev"
  command-line tool to determine the code for a specific key.
  Launch the command, then type the key in question and watch
  the output.
